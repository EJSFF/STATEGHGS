## How do greenhouse gas emissions vary by state?
### Together, the top 10 greenhouse gas emitting states account for approximately 50% of U.S annual emissions.

Responsible for 12% of the country’s total emissions, Texas is the top emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States. The 873.9 MMT of CO2e that Texas generates annually are equivalent to burning 2 billion barrels of oil or running 224 coal power plants year-round. California, the second highest emitter, produces roughly half of Texas’s emissions.  

In contrast to the top producers, the bottom 10 emitters generate 200 MMT of CO2e per year, roughly equivalent to Michigan’s annual emissions. Vermont, the state with the lowest overall emissions, releases just 7 MMt of CO2 each year.

The energy sector is the largest source of greenhouse gases for every state in the top 10. On average, energy made up 85% of a state’s total emissions. Although the contribution from energy was relatively similar throughout the top 10, the proportional contributions of other sectors varied slightly from state to state. California and Illinois, for example, produced more emissions from agriculture as a percent of total emissions, while New York and Florida had greater contributions from waste. <br />

## How do agricultural emissions vary by state?
### Together, the top 10 agricultural greenhouse gas emitting states account for approximately 57% of U.S. agricultural emissions.

Iowa, which is one of the top producing states of both crops and livestock, claims the number one spot for overall agriculture emissions at 63.33 MMT CO2e per year. Emitting 38.19 MMT CO2 per year, Texas is the next highest producer. Nebraska, California, and Minnesota round out the top 5.  
 
The type of agricultural production occurring in each state heavily influences its emissions.  Animal agriculture is an especially strong predictor of total agriculture emissions. North Carolina, for example, has a robust hog industry, yet low levels of cropland production. Emissions from livestock production, however, are enough to make North Carolina the seventh largest agricultural greenhouse gas emitter.

## How is agricultural GHG  efficiency broken down by state?
### States with the highest hog and cattle populations produce the most emissions per acre. 

To evaluate agricultural greenhouse gas efficiency, each state’s agriculture emissions were compared to several different metrics including state total acreage:

Iowa emits the highest agricultural emissions per acre, followed by North Carolina. Both states are top producers of hogs, indicating that animal agricultural intensity is a strong predictor of a state’s agricultural emissions intensity. Due to their disproportionate impact on total emissions, [hog and cattle populations](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9spaC/5/) are a stronger predictor of total state-level agricultural emissions than [cropland acres.](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cqR9r/3/) <br />

### Methodology 
 
The EPA’s State Inventory Tool (SIT) allows individual states to create their own greenhouse gas inventories. States can produce estimates for each of the 11 modules, which cover emissions from electricity, fossil fuels, agriculture, waste, industry, and forestry. Data used for the above visualizations comes from the World Resource Institute’s CAIT Explorer, which uses the SIT modules to generate emissions estimates for agriculture, waste, industrial processes, and energy in each state. Within SIT, the Ag Module uses default data for livestock and crop production from the USDA’s National Agriculture Statistics Service to generate emissions estimates for each state. The [EPA’s State Inventory Tool’s Agriculture Module](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yB6a1/1/) estimates emissions for the following categories: enteric fermentation, manure management, agriculture soils, rice cultivation, liming, urea fertilization, and agricultural residue burning. Liming of agricultural soils and urea fertilization were historically counted in the Land Use, Land Change and Forestry modules, but they were moved into the Agriculture Module in 2019.  
 

The emissions factors used for each process vary based management criteria and production characteristics. The emissions factor for the manure management, for example, is scaled based on dry and liquid management. Other emissions factors, such as for cattle, are adjusted based on regional production characteristics. Users can also turn on the National Adjustment factor to make the SIT emissions factors match those of the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases. Without the adjustment, the EPA SIT tool underestimates indirect emissions from fertilizers and overestimates indirect livestock and direct soil emissions relative to the National Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases Sources and Sinks.
